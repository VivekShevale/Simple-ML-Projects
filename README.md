# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains multiple projects implementing **classic Machine Learning algorithms**.  
Each algorithm has its own folder, and within it, you’ll find different projects that demonstrate training and evaluation on various datasets.  

The goal of this repo is to build a strong foundation by implementing ML algorithms from scratch as well as using libraries like **scikit-learn, NumPy, and Pandas**.

## Algorithms Covered
- **Linear Regression**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** (uploading soon)
- **Decision Trees** (uploading soon)

(=> More algorithms will be added as I explore further.)

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ml-projects.git
   cd ml-projects

2. Navigate to a specific project folder

   ```bash
   cd linear-regression/Advertising_Sales_Prediction/
   
3. Run the notebook/script.

## Project Highlights

* Hands-on implementation of algorithms.
* Training on different datasets.
* Performance evaluation with metrics (accuracy, RMSE, confusion matrix, etc.).
* Clean and modular code with explanations.

## Notes

Each **project folder** contains:

* `README.md` → Project description, dataset details, results.
* `.csv` → Required datasets.
* Code files (`.ipynb`).
