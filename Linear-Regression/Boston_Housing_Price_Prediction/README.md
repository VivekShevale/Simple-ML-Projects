# Boston Housing Price Prediction - Linear Regression Model

A machine learning project that predicts median home values in Boston using various neighborhood and property characteristics. This analysis helps understand the key factors that influence housing prices in different Boston areas.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the classic Boston Housing dataset to build a predictive model for median home values. The model uses 13 different features including crime rates, room counts, accessibility, and neighborhood characteristics to forecast housing prices, providing insights for real estate investment and urban planning.

## Objectives

- Predict median home values based on neighborhood and property characteristics
- Identify the most important factors influencing Boston housing prices
- Evaluate model performance for real estate price prediction
- Provide insights for real estate investment and urban development decisions

   ```

## Model Performance

The linear regression model shows moderate predictive performance:

- **R² Score**: 0.659 (65.9% of variance explained)
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: $3,150
- **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**: $5,002
- **Mean Square Error (MSE)**: $25,018

## Key Insights

### Feature Importance (Coefficients)

**Most Negative Impact (Decrease Property Values):**
1. **NOX** (-16.02): Air pollution significantly reduces home values
2. **DIS** (-1.52): Distance from employment centers decreases values
3. **PTRATIO** (-0.89): Higher pupil-teacher ratios reduce property values
4. **LSTAT** (-0.44): Higher percentage of lower-status population decreases values

**Most Positive Impact (Increase Property Values):**
1. **RM** (4.75): Additional rooms significantly increase home values
2. **CHAS** (3.24): Proximity to Charles River adds substantial value
3. **RAD** (0.22): Better highway accessibility increases values
4. **ZN** (0.03): Larger residential lots slightly increase values

### Business Recommendations

**For Real Estate Investment:**
- **Prioritize properties with more rooms**: Each additional room adds ~$4,750 in value
- **Seek Charles River proximity**: River access adds ~$3,240 in value
- **Avoid high-pollution areas**: NOX levels strongly correlate with lower values
- **Consider employment accessibility**: Distance from job centers impacts values

**For Urban Planning:**
- **Improve air quality**: Reducing NOX can significantly boost property values
- **Enhance education**: Lower pupil-teacher ratios increase neighborhood appeal
- **Improve transportation**: Better highway access positively impacts values

## Statistical Summary

| Feature | Mean | Std | Min | Max | Impact on Price |
|---------|------|-----|-----|-----|-----------------|
| **CRIM** | 3.61 | 8.72 | 0.01 | 88.98 | Negative |
| **RM** | 6.28 | 0.70 | 3.56 | 8.78 | **Positive** |

## Model Interpretation

The linear regression equation:
```
MEDV = 27.91 + (-0.11×CRIM) + (0.03×ZN) + (-0.03×INDUS) + (3.24×CHAS) + 
       (-16.02×NOX) + (4.75×RM) + (-0.02×AGE) + (-1.52×DIS) + 
       (0.22×RAD) + (-0.01×TAX) + (-0.89×PTRATIO) + (0.01×B) + (-0.44×LSTAT)
```

**Key Interpretations:**
- **Air Quality**: 1 unit increase in NOX decreases home value by $16,020
- **Room Count**: Each additional room increases value by $4,752
- **River Access**: Charles River proximity adds $3,241 in value
- **Education**: Lower pupil-teacher ratios significantly boost values

## Key Findings

### Top Value Drivers
1. **Number of Rooms**: Most important positive factor
2. **Air Quality**: Pollution significantly reduces values
3. **Charles River Access**: Premium location factor
4. **Education Quality**: School quality impacts property values

### Investment Insights
- **Best ROI**: Properties with more rooms in low-pollution areas
- **Premium Locations**: Charles River proximity commands higher prices
- **Avoid**: High-crime, high-pollution neighborhoods
- **Education Matters**: School quality is a significant value driver
