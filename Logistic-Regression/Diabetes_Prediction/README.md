# Diabetes Prediction - Logistic Regression Model

A machine learning project that predicts diabetes onset using logistic regression based on diagnostic measurements and patient characteristics. This analysis identifies key risk factors for Type 2 diabetes and supports early detection screening programs.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset to build a predictive model for diabetes diagnosis. The model uses clinical measurements including glucose levels, BMI, blood pressure, and family history to predict diabetes onset, providing valuable support for diabetes screening and risk assessment programs.

## Objectives

- Predict diabetes onset based on clinical and demographic measurements
- Identify the most significant risk factors for Type 2 diabetes
- Evaluate binary classification performance for medical screening
- Provide insights for diabetes prevention and early intervention programs
