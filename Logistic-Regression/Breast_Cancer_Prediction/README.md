# Breast Cancer Prediction - Logistic Regression Model

A machine learning project that predicts breast cancer diagnosis using logistic regression based on cell nucleus characteristics from fine needle aspirate (FNA) images. This analysis supports medical professionals in cancer screening and diagnostic decision-making.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset to build a predictive model for cancer diagnosis. The model uses 30 computed features from digitized images of cell nuclei to classify tumors as malignant or benign, providing valuable support for pathological analysis and early cancer detection.

## Objectives

- Predict breast cancer diagnosis based on cell nucleus characteristics
- Identify the most significant morphological features for cancer detection
- Evaluate binary classification performance for medical diagnostic support
- Provide insights for pathological analysis and screening programs

## Dataset Description

The Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset contains 569 patient records with comprehensive morphological measurements:

### Features Used for Prediction (30 Features Total)

**Mean Values (10 features):**
- **mean radius**: Mean distance from center to points on perimeter
- **mean texture**: Standard deviation of gray-scale values
- **mean perimeter**: Mean perimeter of nucleus
- **mean area**: Mean area of nucleus
- **mean smoothness**: Mean local variation in radius lengths
- **mean compactness**: Mean perimeter² / area - 1.0
- **mean concavity**: Mean severity of concave portions of contour

```

Note: Dataset is loaded directly from sklearn.datasets (no separate CSV file needed)

## Usage

1. **Load the data from sklearn**:
   ```python
   from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
   cancerData = load_breast_cancer()
   cancer = pd.DataFrame(cancerData.data, columns=cancerData.feature_names)
   cancer['target'] = cancerData.target
   ```

2. **Data exploration**:
   ```python
   # Explore comprehensive feature set
   cancer.info()  # 30 morphological features + target
   cancer.describe()  # Statistical summary of all measurements
   ```

3. **Run the complete analysis**:
   ```python
   # The script includes:
   # - Comprehensive exploratory data analysis
   # - Feature scaling (critical for logistic regression)
   # - Train/test split (70/30)
   # - Logistic regression training with scaled features
   # - Detailed diagnostic performance evaluation
   ```

4. **Make predictions for new cases**:
   ```python
   # Example prediction using scaled features
   sample = pd.DataFrame([X.std().values], columns=X.columns)
   sample_scaled = scaler.transform(sample)
   prediction = model.predict(sample_scaled)
   ```

## Model Performance

The logistic regression model demonstrates excellent diagnostic performance:

- **Overall Accuracy**: 96.5%
- **Precision (Malignant)**: 95%
- **Precision (Benign)**: 97%
- **Recall (Malignant)**: 95%
- **Recall (Benign)**: 97%
- **F1-Score**: 0.96 (both classes)

### Confusion Matrix Analysis
```
                Predicted
Actual    Malignant  Benign
Malignant    54       3
Benign        3      111
```

**Clinical Performance:**
- **True Negatives (54)**: Correctly identified malignant cases
- **True Positives (111)**: Correctly identified benign cases
- **False Positives (3)**: Benign cases flagged as malignant (safer error)
- **False Negatives (3)**: Malignant cases missed (critical to minimize)
