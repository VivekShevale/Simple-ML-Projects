# Heart Disease Prediction - Logistic Regression Model

A machine learning project that predicts the presence of heart disease using logistic regression based on key health indicators. This analysis helps identify patients at risk and supports clinical decision-making for cardiovascular health assessment.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes medical data to build a predictive model for heart disease diagnosis. The model uses essential health metrics including age, gender, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels to predict the likelihood of heart disease, providing valuable support for medical screening and early detection programs.

## Objectives

- Predict heart disease presence based on key health indicators
- Identify the most significant risk factors for cardiovascular disease
- Evaluate binary classification performance for medical diagnosis support
- Provide insights for preventive healthcare and risk assessment

## Dataset Description

The heart disease dataset contains 270 patient records with the following features:

### Features Used for Prediction

```

## Project Structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ heart_v2.csv               # Dataset file

## ðŸš€ Usage

1. **Load and explore the data**:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   ht = pd.read_csv('heart_v2.csv')
   ht.head()
   ```

2. **Data exploration**:
   ```python
   # Check data quality
   ht.info()
   ht.describe()
   ht.isnull().sum()  # No missing values!
   ```

   # - Logistic regression training
   # - Comprehensive model evaluation
   # - Clinical interpretation of results
   ```

4. **Make predictions for new patients**:
   ```python
   # Example prediction for a high-risk patient
   new_patient = pd.DataFrame([{
       'age': 71, 'sex': 0, 'BP': 120, 'cholestrol': 564
   }])
   prediction = model.predict(new_patient)
   probability = model.predict_proba(new_patient)
   ```

## Model Performance

The logistic regression model shows good diagnostic performance:

- **Overall Accuracy**: 70.6%
- **Precision (No Disease)**: 74%
- **Precision (Heart Disease)**: 65%
- **Recall (No Disease)**: 78%
- **Recall (Heart Disease)**: 61%
- **F1-Score**: 0.70 (weighted average)

### Confusion Matrix Analysis
```
                   Predicted
Actual    No Disease  Heart Disease
No Disease     31          9
Heart Disease  11         17
```

**Clinical Interpretation:**
- **True Negatives (31)**: Correctly identified healthy patients
- **True Positives (17)**: Correctly identified heart disease cases
- **False Positives (9)**: Healthy patients flagged as at-risk (safer error)
- **False Negatives (11)**: Heart disease cases missed (critical to minimize)
